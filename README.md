# Nordon´t

This gnome-shell extension does what Nordon´t.

## What is this

For some reason, Nord VPN thinks that Linux users don´t like GUIs and we should
do everything by command line. It happens that this is a false assumption, and
we _do like_ GUIs on our desktops... just not in our servers.

This extension adds a simple status check in your gnome shell top bar telling you
if you are connected to the VPN or not, without having to open a terminal every
time we do it.

This is not meant for final users, but you can just copy this extension to your
gnome extension folder in case this is useful.

This is an option in case you want to use the official client and not the built-in
VPN client.
